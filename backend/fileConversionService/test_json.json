State principles of effective team performance and the functions of different team roles; work effectively in problem-solving teams.\n-Communication. Communicate and document your findings in concise group presentations and a written report.",
      "content": "In urban drainage, the complexity of the decision-making, the available methodologies and the data availability have increased significantly. In current environmental engineering practice, the focus has shifted from tables and nomograms to sophisticated simulation tools.\nThe topics cover:\n-Integrated urban water management\n-Hydrological and hydrodynamic modelling\n-Water quality based assessment\n-Freshwater ecology\n-Hydraulic capacity assessment\n-Sewer network operation\n-Decision analysis",

But also where to seek advice if needed).\nPart II\nThe second, face-to-face part of this course focuses on discipline-specific aspects of Materials, Processes and Manufacturing Technologies.

We will look, learn and apply creative artistic practices to find innovative solutions. And we will also look beyond the artistic practices, into the creative potential of today’s technologies, especially Generative AI.",

They will trace the historical roots of creativity and its contemporary significance, explore how Creative Thinking intersects with modern innovations and technologies.\nThe students will develop a comprehensive understanding of Creative Thinking and its practical application, start to cultivate the ability to generate innovative solutions through creative practices and will analyze the broader implications of creativity in various contexts.",
      "content": "In the business world Creative Thinking is considered to be one of the “top ten skills” or “most In-Demand skill” in 2024. With Creative Thinking innovative solutions to problems are developed and not only a large number of ideas but also a variety and range of them are brainstormed. It seems that in today's dynamic world, creativity isn't just an asset – but actually necessity. \nBut what exactly is Creative Thinking? In the above mentioned business context it is assumed everybody knows. And what is creativity? And how can we use it. Or not. \nOriginally, connected to artistic practice, creativity is nowadays a skill and practice that can be found in all work areas, especially in innovation and maybe even in technological applicaitons themselves. Today, not only because of creative economy, creative cities or innovation, but also because of generative AI creativity has gained new and broad attention. In the seminar we go back in history to the invention of the genius and look at different social subsystems like art, psychology, economy as well as field as fashion, advertisement and arts and crafts, how our understanding of creativity has emerged till today."

      "description": "Every space, outdoor or indoor, exhibits different acoustic properties. These properties depend on the space's shape, size, and surface material; therefore, architects' design influences their resulting acoustical signature. This course introduces room acoustics and its applications in architecture and design.",
      "learning_objectives": "The course lays out the theoretical background on how sound propagates in space, interacts with surfaces, and is ultimately perceived. Furthermore, hands-on exercises provide the tools to measure and analyse the acoustics of existing spaces and how to design and predict the acoustics of modelled spaces. The course provides a comprehensive understanding of acoustics and its practical applications in architecture, enabling students to apply their knowledge of acoustics in real-world scenarios.",
      "content": "The course examines room acoustics and its applications in architecture and design. It introduces physiological and psychoacoustics by exploring audible space impressions in daily life and our ability to perceive and localise sounds. It provides the theoretical background on how sound propagates in space and interacts with surfaces by looking closely into reflection, absorption, and diffusion. It demonstrates basic mathematical and physics concepts such as decibels and reverberation time through practical examples and hands-on exercises. The course examines how headphones and loudspeaker systems made electroacoustics and their application in room acoustics simulation and auralisation, a tool for acoustic design in architecture. It provides the software and hardware tools to measure and analyse the acoustics of existing spaces. It demonstrates acoustic simulation tools for designing and predicting the acoustics of digitally designed spaces.\nLectures by guest speakers round up the content and broaden the focus outside the box. Finally, the course concludes with a short semester thesis, allowing students to apply their acquired knowledge to a small design project.\nThe course format is a 1-hour lecture and a 2-hour hands-on exercise session.",
